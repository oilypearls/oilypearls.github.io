<p>This isnâ€™t a good blog post, but I suppose that doesnâ€™t matter when thereâ€™s no one reading this except for myself and a serendipitious reader.</p>

<p>In complete honesty, there hasnâ€™t been much going in my life. Moments have blurred: waking up, showering, sitting my ass down for ~8 hours, eating, tampering on my phone, then sleeping. Repeat this five times a week. The weekends come and go; theyâ€™re never long enough. Iâ€™m perpetually twiddling my thumbs for inspiration and motivation to hit me, so that I may finally create something extraordinary that may even surprise myself. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoSoZyiHZ6o">Sour times</a>, indeed, that I measure my days by these pointless, trivial acts of humanhood.</p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™s my fault that my current life seems so meaningless. Donâ€™t people say that real meaning is found within yourself and not externally? Maybe thereâ€™s really nothing there inside me, just big empty inside. One thing thatâ€™s been whirling in my emptiness is how much unspoken responsibility that I will have, especially with finances. With all this supposed free time, I could be learning this and that coding language, working on side projects, and reading tech books to prepare for a better job. Isnâ€™t that what all of us want? A better job with a fatter salary? Each time I start a new project or learning plan, I lose all interest and motivation because I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care about best styling practices. I donâ€™t care about what language to choose for a specific task. I donâ€™t care about learning about technical things beyond its ability to give me a decent salary to live a decent life.</p>

<p>With the arrival of spring and summer, some quarantine measures have been lifted and life seems to be moving as it always has in the past. The images of people walking and laughing with their friends, patrons on patios enjoying belated drinks and food, and ballers balling in the courts all paint a form of new normality that presents itself that itâ€™s here to stay. While it is a season to celebrate and take advantage of longer days, I wonder how the people will react if and when the strict measures are placed upon us again after tasting an appetizer of quasi-normality. Will people easily comply as they did in March, or will it be met with resistance as shown in some parts of the States? Seeing people here enter indoor public spaces without masks gives me pause, especially in a time when wearing masks indoors is heavily encouraged and have shown to stop the spread of COVID. It is the selfishness of such people that welcomes me to my pessimism. Perhaps in the near future, I will be proven wrong.</p>
