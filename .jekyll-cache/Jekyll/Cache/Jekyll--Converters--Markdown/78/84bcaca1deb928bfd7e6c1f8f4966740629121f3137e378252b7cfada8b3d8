I"ƒ<p>This isnâ€™t a good blog post, but I suppose that doesnâ€™t matter when thereâ€™s no one reading this except for myself and a serendipitious reader.</p>

<p>In complete honesty, there hasnâ€™t been much going in my life. If anything, moments have blurred into one: from waking up, to the shower, to sitting my ass down for ~8 hours, eating, tampering on my phone, then sleeping marks the highlight of my days. Repeat this five times a week. The weekends come and go; theyâ€™re never long enough. Iâ€™m perpetually twiddling my thumbs for inspiration and motivation to hit me, so that I may finally create something extraordinary that may even surprise myself. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoSoZyiHZ6o">Sour times</a>, indeed.</p>

<p>With the arrival of spring and summer, some quarantine measures have been lifted and life seems to be moving as it always has in the past. The images of people walking and laughing with their friends, patrons on patios enjoying belated drinks and food, and ballers balling in the courts all blend into a form of normality that unconvincingly tries to show that this new normal rooted and here to stay.</p>
