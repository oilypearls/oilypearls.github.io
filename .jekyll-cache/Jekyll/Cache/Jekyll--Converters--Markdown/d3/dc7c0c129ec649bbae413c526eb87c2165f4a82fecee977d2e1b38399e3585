I"Ï<p>This isnâ€™t a good blog post, but I suppose that doesnâ€™t matter when thereâ€™s no one reading this except for myself and a serendipitious reader.</p>

<p>In complete honesty, there hasnâ€™t been much going in my life. If anything, moments have blurred into one: from waking up, to the shower, to sitting my ass down for ~8 hours, eating, tampering on my phone, then sleeping marks the highlight of my days. Repeat this five times a week. The weekends come and go; theyâ€™re never long enough. Iâ€™m perpetually twiddling my thumbs for inspiration and motivation to hit me, so that I may finally create something extraordinary that may even surprise myself. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoSoZyiHZ6o">Sour times</a>, indeed.</p>

<p>With the arrival of spring and summer, some quarantine measures have been lifted and life seems to be moving as it always has in the past. The images of people walking and laughing with their friends, patrons on patios enjoying belated drinks and food, and ballers balling in the courts all paint a form of new normality that presents itself that itâ€™s here to stay. While it is a season to celebrate and take advantage of longer days, I wonder how the people will react if and when the strict measures are placed upon us again after tasting an appetizer of quasi-normality. Will people easily comply as they did in March, or will it be met with resistance as shown in some parts of the States? Seeing people enter indoor public spaces without masks gives me pause, though perhaps it is my pessimism speaking.</p>

<p>How long will it be until shops and patios close again? When will new research come out and say that everything we knew about COVID is close, but not completely correct? This so-called new normality leans on assumptions that may topple with one fatal touch. Considering that deadlier waves were observed with past pandemics, it would not be surprising to see</p>

<p>This sentiment comes from greedy, self-serving motivations.</p>
