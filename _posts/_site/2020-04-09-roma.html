<p>In the time of a public health crisis, my city has been on an indefinte semi-lockdown for about three weeks, which has given me lots of unused time. See, when I was in school or was too busy to think about leisure activities, I always longed to watch a movie on my perpetually growing list. While I have already watched Roma in late December 2018, it left quite an impression on me. With its beautiful cinematography and subtle yet plot that captures the burdens of everyday life with quiet commentary of the classism, misogyny, and racial divides of 1970’s Mexico.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank the lockdown for giving me almost unlimited time to enjoy myself with movies, both visited and unvisited.</p>

<p>In this post, there will be a lot of spoilers, and no real unifying theme except to show the subtle symbolism with the blatant contrasts of this movie.</p>

<hr />

<p>I went into the theatres with friends not knowing what to expect; before entering the hall, all I had seen was the large poster, with its golden art deco font, decreeing ROMA, as a family embraced each other with palpable emotion on the beach. Alright, it looked good enough to spend 2 hours with each other, but I feel like it was more than just a way to pass the time. From what I can remember, it moved all of us that day.</p>

<p>Roma begins with one of its most important symbols: water. Water cleanses, destroys, and nurtures. We see the actions of our silent protagonist, Cleo, a maid of well-to-do family in 1970’s Roma, a (now gentrified) middle-class neighbourhood in Mexico City. A new day begs for a clean slate, washed by soap and water.</p>

<p>Look at the tones and textures of the floor: a mundane scene is turned beautiful by these two important factors, something that we see many times throughout (but is not discussed here, sorry).</p>

<p>Cleo takes a small break with the family’s youngest, Pepe, where she pretends she is dead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I like being dead.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Pepe pretends to die for fun, Cleo says this with a modicum of seriousness. What kind of troubles has she faced? At least in that moment, she is able to lie back and enjoy the gentle sun beaming down with the scent and sounds of everyday life. We are troubled, but it’s quickly dismissed; instead, we absorb the soft, gorgeous moments of serenity.<br />

<p>Nice houses, nice kids, and nice cars - it’s all superficial. Cleo and Pepe see the mother (Sofia) bid adieu to the father (Antonio), as he leaves for two weeks for a conference. From their tense body language, the audience knows the peace has been broken. Antonio is being embraced by his wife out of desperation, whereas Cleo hugs Pepe - simply because he lets her.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-09-roma/embrace.jpeg" alt="Water" /></p>

<p>Now… look at these. Cleo has been seeing a seemingly nice boy named Fermin, and in these moments, we feel uncomfortable at how intimate it is. Should we be witnessing their young, budding love? It feels like I’m violating their privacy. Nevertheless, I love how Cuarón framed the handholding scene, with Fermin in extreme focus and heavy contrast against the hotel background - Cuarón forcibly moves our chin and orders us: “Look”… and look we do. The way he holds her hands with such care and focus and how she smiles makes the audience believe that true love might actually exist.<br />

<p>But nah, true love doesn’t exist, at least not in this movie if we understand the dynamic between Sofia and Antonio. After missing her period, Cleo realizes she’s pregnant and tells Fermin at the smoky movie theatre, who promptly leaves with the perfect excuse of going to the washroom. (Hint: he never waits for her.) Upset at the prospect of being fired, Cleo confides in Sofia, who is more than happy for her and takes her to the hospital to confirm her pregnancy.</p>

<p>With New Years waiting, Sofia takes her family to her friend’s hacienda, where everyone drinks a bit too much and has a bit of fun, until “Fire!” is heard by all. Everyone scurries to put out the fire, running to fetch water, lining up to hand filled buckets; seemingly everyone has forgotten about the New Year. Enter the guy in a costume, who sings to ring in the New Year. Everyone forgets about him too, but he keeps singing - to appease whom? To me, an intense scene that shows the absurdity of life.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-09-roma/fire.jpeg" alt="Water" /></p>

<p>After returning from the hacienda, Cleo is determined to find Fermin, and she finds herself in an underdeveloped village outside of Mexico City - in the background, a political candidate campaigns that he will bring water here! She finds herself at a field where Fermin trains martial arts. A funny looking dude called the “Guru” demonstrates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vriksasana">vriksasana</a> while blindfolded. Everyone laughs and expects something impossible to happen, but he shuts down everyone by asking them to do it.</p>

<p>No one’s laughing now. The bystanders and trainees all have a difficult time doing a seemingly easy task - but not Cleo. Despite her silent anguish, she is the only one capable of perfectly balancing, showing her quiet yet resilient strength.</p>

<p>Though Cleo is finally able to meet him, her quest is futile, as Fermin threatens to beat her and her child if she tries to see him again, then calling her a “servant bitch”. Defeated, she returns back to Mexico City, where later she encounters a very drunk Sofia. While Fermin is dismissive, Sofia understands Cleo with a careless embrace. They share a moment of solidarity as women who have lost significant others, mingled with a cold touch of reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We women are always alone.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are both alone in their struggles, yet understand each other perfectly.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-09-roma/alone.jpeg" alt="alone" /></p>

<p>Time passes, and Cleo is nearly due, which means they need furniture for the baby. The abuelita takes Cleo to a shopping trip for the baby, and as they walk to the store from their car, they face a tense atmosphere of students with signs and soldiers on standby. It’s all very palpable and the audience is uneasy.</p>

<p>If this isn’t a goddamn obvious metaphor for a ticking bomb to denote what will happen immediately, then I don’t know what is.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-09-roma/clocks.jpeg" alt="clocks" /></p>

<p>Within seconds of entering the store, the streets are in discord, with shots heard in the air, as people, both protesters and soldiers, are running around to escape or to attack. I don’t know much about Mexican history, but it is implied that the soldiers were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Halconazo#Los_Halcones">Los Halcones</a>, a government trained military group that were used to suppress protests during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Dirty_War">Mexico’s turbulent times</a>. Two protestors barge into the store, desperate for some help, yet the soldiers find them and one of them is executed.</p>

<p>There is an incredibly tense moment, where Cleo sees Fermin (!) again - this time, he has a gun. We think back to his threat before: will he kill Cleo and her child? After uncomfortable stares and seconds, he leaves with his group; everyone is safe yet Cleo’s water breaks.</p>

<p>It takes them two hours to get the hospital, and the pressure is building up, with the cries of babies and the astounding number of people waiting for treatment. While others wait in line, Cleo is able to get treatment as the family has ties to the hospital. As Cleo is taken to the emergency, abuelita is asked information about Cleo that she cannot answer. Cleo is taken for granted by the family, an object that cleans, cooks, and shops without a complaint. They know so much about us, but do we know anything about them?

<p>The doctors do their best and Cleo crowns and gives birth - but no cries are heard. The baby is not breathing and after futile attempts of CPR, they announce to her that her baby is a girl. Everyone is sorry. 
Cleo mourns her baby’s life, as the doctors dress her child in a cool, clinical way, as if the baby was an object.<br />

<p>Sofia, noticing Cleo’s anguish, invites her to the family’s vacation to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuxpan">Tuxpan</a>, hoping that it will clear her mind. Cleo reluctantly accepts the invitation.  And… off we go.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-09-roma/landscape.jpeg" alt="landscape" /></p>

<p>Mexico is gorgeous, isn’t it? Everything’s soft and of the same tone. The composition is well laid, giving  equal balance to the solemn sky and the desert, the clouds a foreboding warning of the things that might happen.</p>

<p>The children beg Sofia to swim at the beach before they go to their hotel, and she agrees. They are happy and bubbly rolling around in the sand and beach. After arriving at the hotel, the family sits down at a restaurant where Sofia breaks the news: the reason for the trip was so that Antonio can take his things without discomfort. She explains that while they are separated, daddy still loves them and that they’ll be closer than ever - including Cleo. The family shows their love for Cleo, who, despite looking uncomfortable, is receptive to their affections.</p>

<p>What’s a big, sad family dinner without dessert to sweeten the misery? As everyone dejectedly eats their ice cream, there is a quiet moment as a couple takes their wedding photo, which suddenly breaks into energetic bursts of laughter and music. On one hand, there is a dissolution of a marriage and on the other, a formation of one.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-09-roma/dissolution.jpeg" alt="Water" /></p>

<p>The next day, the family packs to leave, but they decide to visit the beach once more where the waves are rougher than before. The children are warned not to go too deep as Sofia and Toño, her eldest son, leave to go to the store, but knowing children, they don’t listen. Cleo watches from the sand as they become smaller and smaller. While she cannot swim, she bravely faces the waves and saves them.</p>

<p>Here, I was wondering if she would have done that for a stranger, as she cannot swim and have faced so much grief in the past. Why save a stranger who might not be grateful? Why do that if she might die? Seeing the glimpses of Cleo does make me think otherwise, that she would risk her life so that the other person might not suffer like her. She understands how hard it is to be alone and how isolating traumas can be, so she does what is right.</p>

<p>As Sofia and Toño return to Cleo and the crumpled children, they break down, embrace one another, and show their devotion to her. This is a moment of vulnerability of Cleo - after deciding to receive their love, she tells them what she could not tell anyone else, that she never wanted the baby, but also of the pain that lingered when her baby was stillborn. To feel conflicting emotions is a painful burden to bear and even more so to share it with a family who might not understand.</p>

<p>A quiet drive back to Mexico City reveals their house to be reorganized - shelves gone, books on the ground, and rooms are switched around. The children are ecstatic about the new arrangement and have put the bad news in the back of their heads. It is time to rejoyce in the small, simple things.</p>

<p>In the last moments of the movie, Cleo climbs the stairs to the roof to attend to her normal chores while a plane flies in the sky. Things seem to be looking up for Cleo; this pain too shall pass.
