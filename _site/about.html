<p>AE was borne of a fruit, brought from the ides of March on a summer breeze on Mars. They say that AE was actually a pinecone, but back then, no one had good descriptive words to categorize what she was, so they threw her really, really hard until she somehow hit the stoned cabinetmakers, whom became her zombie caretakers. Though their limbs were perpetually decaying, they taught her how to make the most horrendously and beautifully ugly cabinets where she likes to spend her time hiding from the world. Because of her ethereal form, she can transform herself flat like one of the layers of a mille-feuille cake. This is what happens when one bullshits a lot - they gain some kind of superpower that just keeps giving.</p>
